# Fake-News-Detection

The code is for detecting fake news using 2 datasets - ISOT Dataset and LIAR dataset.
Two different methods have been used to detect fake news -
i) Only the title of each news article is considered and classification is done.
ii) Along with the title, extra features like the POS tags for the title, number of words and number of characters in the title is considered and classification is done.
